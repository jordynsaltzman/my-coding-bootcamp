# My Coding Bootcamp (IN PROGRESS)

https://mycodingbootcamp.herokuapp.com/

Create topics of interest, save online resources, keep track of progress, learn to code!

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). I implemented user authentication with JSON Web Token and password encryption using bcrypt.

## Description

Developers would likely be lost without the abundance of coding resources found online, such as documentation, Youtube videos, and Stack Overflow threads. I constantly find myself saving online resources to the Bookmarks bar, but when I switch browsers or devices, I often cannot access my Bookmarks. I wanted my favorite resources to be easily accessible from any machine and browser.

_My Coding Bootcamp_ is an application where users can save and organize their favorite online coding resources into topics of their choice. After utilizing one of their saved resources, they have the option to mark it complete in order to keep track of their progress. Users can also easily remove topics and resources from their account.
